Sometimes you stumble across something you did in the past and while it shows its age, you're still fond of it. Here's one of those things for me. The design isn't mine, but the animation you'll see here is a JavaScript animation sequence I developed to take in any number of frames, tap positions, and animation preferences. It's something that I originally built to take a scroll position as a trigger, but in this case it's entirely keyframe based. It's not a video at all.

This relies on JQuery, whereas today I could cover all of the animations with CSS.

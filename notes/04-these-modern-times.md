Ten to one\
I count, undone\
After the bitter march of ghouls with guns\
Hundreds more, lest they rest\
Willing hearts sent to wreck


“Chill out, bro\
It’s just the news.\
Put it down, give it a rest.\
Here, try the new Meta Quest.”

I'm someone who's always excited to try new technology as it releases. While I sincerely mean no judgement toward any of us being consumers, something doesn't feel right to me about spending nearly $4,000 on a VR headset, or even $500 for that matter, if I haven't contributed at least this much to liberating Palestine, to Ukraine, to trans rights, to reproductive rights, to women's rights. The list continues.

I can often justify a technology expense as being a step in increasing earning potential. Perhaps that also increases my donation potential as well. In times like today, though - it feels like wishful thinking.

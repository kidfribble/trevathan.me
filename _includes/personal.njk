  <h2>Life</h2>
    <p>I've had a long, complicated journey studded with critical influences that I credit my quality of life and ability to actively pursue my interests to. I didn't come from a likely place, was born with an absurdly different name (I grew up as Steven, however), and was more likely to be addicted to drugs or dead by now than where I've journeyed to. This is a debt I could never truly repay, but I'll do my best to honor it through living well with a positive, generous mindset, and give as much as I can with the skills I've developed to the potential of others.</p>

    <p>At eleven, inheriting my first computer marked the start of my tech journey, spurred by my parents' divorce and my father's indifference to technology. I was fixated. It was how I escaped and found my own community when I felt I had no others. Bullied and without a support network, I sought parental figures in my teachers and those friends I'd make online and eventually within my neighborhood. Their influence would uncover for me just how much more there was to life, and how much I stood to gain. To be honest, none of those friendships would have formed if they were in my school system - if you're a well known target in your school system, most people want to avoid the blast radius. Being just outside the roughest part of my town, I met the right young pals who'd share interests and open me up to so much more.</p>
    
    <p>Designing and developing websites eventually allowed me to buy my own food for a summer. Creating a Diablo 1 strategy and community website earned me lifelong friends and collaborators. Eventually, in high school, I was chosen by my Information Technology shop instructor for a unique opportunity at a <a href="https://www.vanvolumes.com/" target="_blank">local print shop</a>. I truly found purpose in technology where I felt I had none elsewhere. I'd manage the print shop's website design and development, edit and prepare book covers for printing, and even assist other print shop personnel running the presses.<p/>
    
    <p>I am grateful for these experiences. They were foundational and opened up a tremendously fruitful career path. Having purpose is a powerful thing to hold, and it can be difficult to retain. Today I still find it in technology and design, though it's expanded to visual arts, music, writing, and supporting my friend-family, my dogs, and the well-being of the body I've been given.<p/>

    <p>The opportunities to join and create many successful product teams as a founder, director, manager, product designer, and developer were not without significant self-improvement and dedication to leaving things better than how I found them.</p>
    
    <p>Perhaps someday we'll meet, reader, and we too may become friends, collaborators, and share our commitment to the well-being of ourselves and our communities.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies &amp; Family History</h3>
    <p>I perform the marimba, guitar, drums, keyboards, vocals, and write all of my music.</p>

    <p>I am also a photographer, a dog trainer, a distance runner, a health and fitness enthusiast, and an absolute fiend in role playing strategy games. I'm also painfully good at Jenga.</p>
  
    <p>By this point you're probably aware that my early childhood and family life was pretty frayed, but it wasn't without it's own signficantly positive sides. My grandfather was an awarded US Air Force Wartime Navigator who served in WWII and was also the inventor of the honeycomb - a fuel efficiency cell designed to ensure astronauts would have the fuel to return home from the moon. His prototype was installed on Apollo 11. While I didn't inherit his mechanical engineering skills, that creative mechanical thinking runs in the family and they were a legend to me. My father taught me everything I know about physical mechanical structures and imprinted on me an ingenuity I still surprise myself with.</p>

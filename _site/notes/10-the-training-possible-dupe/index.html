          <p>I'm about three months away from starting my second marathon training, this time for an ultramarathon covering 50k, and there are many things I plan to do differently. Anyone undertaking a challenging endeavor for the first time is bound to learn a great deal about that activity, what made it difficult for them, and how they might approach it differently in the future.</p>
<p>Last time, I &quot;trained to train,&quot; and this approach was beneficial. I exercised most days, limiting my total weekly mileage to fewer than 10 miles, focusing more on strength training and yoga. This strategy worked well for my fitness level at the time and set me up for success with the kind of strain I was about to put my body through when the real training began. That's when the learning truly started. My form, shoes, mindset, diet, and guilty habits were all suddenly up for adjustment.</p>
<p>Today, I'm exercising for about 90 minutes every day, primarily focusing on yoga, strength training, biking, and hiking. It's a lot of activity, broken up into multiple sessions throughout the day. I don't think I could have made this a routine if not for having trained for that first marathon and experiencing what it was like to fully commit and endure in this way.</p>
<p>With this post, I want to share some key takeaways from my experience. I hope you might find yourself interested in these activities, especially if you're considering undertaking this sort of extended training yourself. By dedicating the necessary preparation time, you will realize the undeniable value and health benefits, especially from consistent yoga practice.</p>
<h2>Training for Training</h2>
<p>Growing up, I played baseball and got familiar with gymnastics via our absurd childhood stunts, which I couldn't seem to stop doing. Moreover, I learned about gymnastics form and training by dating a wonderfully talented and patient person who was a gymnastics coach at the time (and is now a trapeze artist). I'm sharing this to emphasize that I'm starting from a different place than many, and to underscore that what you read here should be seen through that lens. Not only do we all start from different levels of fitness and body awareness, but our bodies are different. What I've done in the past is not a requirement, but it is my starting place, and it's far from starting at zero.</p>
<p>Once my career in design truly started after college, I focused everything I had on the computer and kept my stressful and woefully underpaid first job; this led to numerous injuries due to inactivity, hunching over for endless hours, and having very few hobbies that involved my body without a keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>When I became financially stable enough to monitor my health and get myself back into shape, I still didn't start from nothing. I was fortunate to remember the experience of breaking through physical barriers and the parallel experience of stress on my body that would fade over time. More importantly, I retained the belief that I could do it and the commitment to see it through.</p>
<p>Today, my body is very different from when I was 18 and could do a standing backflip. Now, with a disc in my neck consistently threatening to herniate, cartilage removed from my right knee (causing early signs of arthritis), and carpal tunnel forming in my overused right wrist, I'm on a quest to finish a 50k in October and to be able to hold a 1-minute-long handstand by the end of 2024. The handstand is the stretch goal; the 50k is simply part of my ongoing fitness objectives. I don't care about personal records, but I do care about my resilience.</p>
<p>To achieve this, I'm first sculpting my own training for the three months preceding the running training. We're going to cover the three most important aspects of my pre-training: yoga, keto &amp; quitting smoking marijuana, and strength training.</p>
<h3>My Yoga Practice</h3>
<p>Most of my days already include some form of yoga in the evenings. I honestly don't understand the science of it, but it seems to bring blood flow through all those areas of my body that need to cycle blood out while breaking up muscle facia and reducing my overall inflammation. Other days, I make yoga the main event for the sake of deep stretches, flexibility, balance, and above all, body awareness.</p>
<p>What is body awareness? If you're just hearing that for the first time, or have only heard it as part of a woo-woo marketing campaign, you might be considering closing this tab already. I understand, but I hope you'll stick with this, as there is much more to the concept than you may expect or initially experience.</p>
<p>Your body is an intricate network of hopefully happy but often not-so-happy components, interconnected by complex muscle weaves forming pulleys and joints. You can study anatomy to gain a precise understanding of each bone and muscle and their functions, but that's no substitute for your physical awareness within your own body. In my experience, there are two types of body awareness: logical awareness and present awareness. Logical awareness is simply knowing that something exists (or doesn't), while present awareness involves being in tune with your body - observing how it moves, listening to your mind, exploring how pressure in one area affects soreness in another, etc. It's about being the playhead to your body's record. Developing a keen present awareness is invaluable, especially for enduring activities like running for 5+ hours.</p>
<p>In my experience, yoga is the best way to develop a strong sense of present awareness. While running also helps, the level of mindfulness you bring to your breathing and its impact on various systems within your body during yoga is uniquely beneficial. It has transformed how I run, lift, and even perform music.</p>
<p>Some tips for getting started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin with small, manageable sessions.</li>
<li>Distinguish between soreness and injury when you feel discomfort.</li>
<li>Start with short routines and gradually increase your practice.</li>
<li>Aim for one intensive yoga session after building up your tolerance.</li>
</ul>
<p>For beginners, I highly recommend taking a 40-minute vinyasa class at a studio. If the studio offers different levels, start with Level 1 vinyasa. Being new might feel awkward, but remember, it's a common feeling for everyone at the start, and your classmates are too focused on their practice to judge. A good instructor will guide you through variations to prevent overexertion while teaching you how to develop the balance and depth of stretch you need. Starting in a studio allows you to learn by observing others and receiving direct feedback from an instructor. Finding an instructor who suits your needs may take a few tries; not every class will be a perfect fit, and finding a great instructor is as challenging as finding any professional you resonate with.</p>
<p>If you prefer starting a yoga practice at home, I recommend &quot;Yoga with Tim&quot; or &quot;Yoga with Adriene.&quot; Tim focuses on power yoga and includes challenging core exercises, while Adriene emphasizes restorative practices. Both offer varied workouts, but this is how I differentiate when deciding between their sessions.</p>
<p>Having practiced yoga for about seven years, I often create my own sequences based on how my body feels that day. This approach works well for my restorative sessions, though I also attend classes or follow online videos for more structured workouts. However, like many, I find that participating in a class pushes me to work harder.</p>
<h3>Introducing Keto &amp; Quitting Marijuana</h3>
<p>I'm altering my diet for this pre-training period to a moderate ketogenic diet and will transition to a cyclical ketogenic diet when it's time for consistent long-distance runs. I find the keto diet to be very effective in providing energy for my current activities and in keeping me optimistic and happy, without relying heavily on carbs for energy throughout the day.</p>
<p>However, starting this diet proved to be challenging. Part of the difficulty stemmed from my routine consumption of full-sugar ice cream (curse you, Van Leeuwen and Salt &amp; Straw), which was largely driven by my regular use of marijuana for evening music sessions and as a sleep aid. This habit led to semi-frequent midnight ice cream snacks, ensuing sugar dependency, and a self-perpetuating psychosomatic belief that it was aiding in stress reduction and positivity. While it's commonly known that smoking can increase hunger, these are not the potential downsides communicated when making a purchase at a dispensary. Initially, we often hear about the holistic benefits of cannabis through hearsay. I have since ceased to believe in its purported benefits.</p>
<p>After about three years, I've come to believe that regular marijuana use is a net negative, especially for those with addictive tendencies, and I would advise such individuals to avoid it entirely. There's ample research available online about its effects on your brain, body, and lungs, so I won't delve into that here. It simply became unsustainable for me, and I decided it was time.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, adopting a keto diet was instrumental in breaking my marijuana habit and ultimately quitting weed for good. It wasn't that keto curbed the craving as much as it disrupted a significant reward I would normally experience when enjoying THC. I started by switching to keto-friendly ice cream, which was great at first but eventually lost its appeal, and then gradually reduced my marijuana intake to less than once a week. Essentially, I embarked on two diets simultaneously: reducing my THC intake to nearly zero through regular periods of abstinence and limiting my carb intake to fewer than 50g per day. This upheaval threw my emotions into disarray, but I was focused on the benefits awaiting me on the other side, and I reached my goal.</p>
<p>Adhering to a keto diet has also aided me in achieving my ideal weight, offering several key benefits beyond general health improvements. With lower cholesterol and visceral fat levels, I'm now carrying less weight when I run. I've lost around 35 pounds (and counting) which is a lot of extra weight to be carrying for fifty kilometers. Having achieved this milestone and now nearing my ideal weight of 180 pounds, I plan to incorporate more substantial strength training into my routine. This aspect is crucial, as I anticipate confronting around 2000 feet of elevation in my most challenging training runs. With these considerations in mind, it's time to delve into the specifics of the strength-building efforts that will support these goals.</p>
<h3>Strength Training</h3>
<p>Aside from my warmup stretches, below is the routine I adhere to two to three times a week. I maintain my yoga practice and go hiking every day, even on days designated for strength training. I advise against adopting my specific regimen wholesale, as it's tailored to my needs'everyone's body is unique, and we each find strength in different ways. Nevertheless, I'm sharing this because it represents a challenging yet manageable level for me. During the final weeks leading up to my running training, I anticipate increasing the weight in my squat exercises, particularly if I continue to feel especially strong.</p>

<p>This pre-training regimen will undergo significant changes once I begin my training runs, with a shifted focus towards core and upper body stability. However, the running itself will naturally strengthen my legs enough to handle the distance. Yoga remains the one unwavering element in my routine. Throughout all phases of training, I will continue practicing yoga, as it not only builds core strength but also aids in the recovery of recently stressed muscles and reduces inflammation throughout the body, particularly in the lower back and hips. In many respects, it addresses all the physical therapy exercises prescribed for my knee, wrist, elbow, and shoulder, encapsulating them into one comprehensive practice.</p>
<h2>The Race Training</h2>
<p>My race training regimen is derived from  [Inov-8's beginner 50 mile ultramarathon training program], though I anticipate making some adjustments based on my response to the Hill Repetitions. This approach contrasts with [Hal Higdon's novice marathon training program] I followed previously, which included a day of rest before the longest runs'a component absent from this new plan. Despite expecting this difference to pose a challenge during the initial weeks, I am confident it won't impede my progress all that much.</p>

<p>Throughout this training journey, I'm looking forward to sharing updates on my progress, including the challenges I face, my recovery strategies, and the stunning vistas I'll encounter along the way. A highlight for sure will be attaching GoPros to my cattle dogs to capture their view of the run and their weary owner leading the pack.</p>
<p>As part of this work and my promotion of it, I am fundraising for the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention. Recent personal losses have underscored the value of this training in keeping me connected to the joys of life, motivating me to extend the benefits of my efforts beyond my own health and self-esteem.</p>

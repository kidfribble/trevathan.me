          <p>Angling upward to the left and fading into darkness, unseen. Tree branches cast
gentle shadows in the street light.</p>
<p>The road curves ahead and out of sight, on a trajectory that appears to end with the moon.</p>
<p>Were I not standing where I am today, the road ahead would not exist to me. Not with this angle beckoning me to
move onward and witness the vantage it would provide.</p>
<p>That moon so bold and high in the night sky. The road arching and disappearing out of view. Logic prevails that this road wont lead to rest with the giant in the sky, but while I may not stand upon it, I can still cast my own gentle shadow in its light. That'll do.</p>

          <p>What you see on this site is pretty simple today. Mostly html pages with a ton of images and columns for text. Whatâ€™s going on is much more interesting.</p>
<p>On the presentation and html file generation side, Iâ€™m building the site using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> and deploying on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> (which is watching my â€˜mainâ€™ branch on the Github repo). This is essentially a turn key setup.</p>
<p>Being a designer, perhaps I should more interested in the presentation layer (well, and the writing), but I am busy building a self-hosted markdown authoring system that allows me to send many file formats (.jpg, .heic, .md, .mp4, and so on) via an <a href="https://expo.dev/">Expo</a>/React Native mobile app interface that I developed to collect and pass data to a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">websocket</a> server running locally on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 4</a>. The Pi4 is also running <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a> and <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> to process media into appropriate formats, then publishes these with the appropriate text files to a branch that is auto deployed for review on Vercel.</p>
<p>This isnâ€™t a completed work, but itâ€™s also not overwhelmingly difficult to do and creates a frictionless way for me to contribute to my site from any device, and anywhere by using my <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> VPN setup for home network access. Outside of the DNS and hosting costs I'd have to cover anyway, this doesn't cost me anything but a little electricity and elbow grease to do.</p>
<p>While it isnâ€™t something thatâ€™d make sense for a very broad audience,  I think some dev-minded designers like myself may also prefer to roll their own and get an infinitely configurable publishing interface. Itâ€™s fun, it teaches you things, and you won't even have to bash your brain against a system that contorts the web medium into a form suiting a wider audience. You get to apply what you know.</p>
<p>The code for this will go up on GitHub as &quot;Webelos&quot;, along with an example site, code backing it, and methods for doing this yourself, <a href="https://github.com/kidfribble/webelos">right here</a>.</p>

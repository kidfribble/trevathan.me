          <p>Ten to one<br>
I count, undone<br>
After the bitter march of ghouls with guns<br>
Hundreds more, lest they rest<br>
Willing hearts sent to wreck</p>
<p>'Chill out, bro<br>
It's just the news.<br>
Put it down, give it a rest.<br>
Here, try the new Meta Quest.'</p>
<p>I'm someone who's always excited to try new technology as it releases. While I sincerely mean no judgement toward any of us being consumers, something doesn't feel right to me about spending nearly $4,000 on a VR headset, or even $500 for that matter, if I haven't contributed at least this much to liberating Palestine, to Ukraine, to trans rights, to reproductive rights, to women's rights. The list continues.</p>
<p>I can often justify a technology expense as being a step in increasing earning potential. Perhaps that also increases my donation potential as well. In times like today, though - it feels like wishful thinking.</p>

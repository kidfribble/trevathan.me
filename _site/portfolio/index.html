        <p>Starting with some past customer work (some are fairly old), I'm just scratching the surface here. There's an immense backlog of work over the recent years to cover. I'm posting various side projects and development work over in the <a href="/notes">notes section</a>, and keeping this area focused more on design, community, and my own product work.</p>

<p>I worked with a small group of developers on a project to support Nugget Market as they transformed their grocery technology strategy to prepare for both using it themselves and licensing the grocer business management tools to others.</p>
<ul>
<li>UX research of grocery inventory management, point of sale, and purchase order experiences</li>
<li>UX design and prototyping</li>
<li>Over the course of this project I tested and delivered many different functional areas of the suite, trained one designer up on the project for my client, and ran several ideation workshops to source ideas for exploration, testing, and to keep momentum on the creative work.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the principle designer of Make&amp;Model I worked with the CVision team and their customers to conceive of a user experience that would allow marine biologists and researchers to much more efficiently transform huge amounts of video data into actionable insights. Later in the project I worked with a brand designer from my team at Make&amp;Model to work out the core brand tones that the website and the product would take on. The brand direction of this is the product of our collaboration, while the overall product design and organizational experience are my sole work product.</p>

<p>2014–2018 (New York, California, Maine)</p>
<p>UX camp is a design retreat of intentially limited size. 30 total campers escape the distracting city and focus on their craft together. Campers work, live, and eat alongside each other, speakers, workshoppers, organizers, and musical performers. It is a true treat and will see future iterations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Founded as an unconference, UX Camp quickly became inspiration for many 'camp' style events organized between 2015 and today.</li>
<li>I ran fundraising, sourcing speakers, workshop coordination, setting event schedules and fallbacks, sourcing musical artists, selecting a proper venue, managing catering, and directed all marketing</li>
<li>During the events (beside one I co-lead in 2018), I lead its programming, volunteers, media recording, and ensured sponsorship was well represented</li>

<p>I've collaborated with CareerVillage for the better part of a decade, as an independent designer and at each of my agencies I grew. Their mission is to democratize access to career guidance, allowing learners of all walks to ask questions of professionals in their careers of interest today. Think of it as more targeted Quora. On the back side, though, there are many more tools available to students, educators, corporate volunteer teams, and professionals. I've helped CareerVillage on everything from interaction design to coaching product management and co-leading their roadmap with CEO Jared Chung.</p>

<p>I collaborated with my design team during a growth phase to revitalize the design and content of Imperfect Foods marketing website, e-commerce design patterns, and later developed a 5 year visual product roadmap, contributing to a kinder, less wasteful world. Our first project aimed at increasing average order value, reduce cancellations, bounces, and improve awareness of the value of food 'Imperfections'. Our work led to a 17% decrease in cancellations, a 20-30% decrease in first order bounces, and a 10-12% increase in first and second average order value.</p>

<p>The National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) originally contracted with my team at Make&amp;Model to make some quick adjustments to their data displays in MarketView (not shown here). We would rengage many times resulting in much of the work of mine that you see here.</p>
<p>The work involved much planning and collaboration with the backend teams of DASL, Compensation Explorer, and MarketView, but also with NAIS member career educators who would come to use the products made available to them.</p>
<p>There's a lot that was processed and sewn into the product experiences demonstrated, though for today, your best bet at getting a good overview is to read the case study on Make&amp;Model's site.</p>

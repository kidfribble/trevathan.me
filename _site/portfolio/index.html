        <p>I'm just scratching the surface here, and NDAs prohibit me from openly sharing a large portion of my recent and proudest product work. There's an immense backlog from recent years to cover, and while I work on these I'm also posting various side projects and development work over in the <a href="/notes">notes section</a>, while aiming to keep this page focused on design, community, and my independent product work.</p>

<p>As the principal designer at Make&amp;Model, I collaborated with the CVision team and their customers to conceive a user experience that would allow marine biologists and researchers to transform huge amounts of video data into actionable insights much more efficiently. Later in the project, I worked with a brand designer from my team at Make&amp;Model to establish the core brand tones that both the website and the product would adopt. The brand direction is the product of our collaboration, while the overall product design and organizational experience are my work.</p>

<p>The National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) originally contracted with my team at Make&amp;Model to make quick adjustments to their data displays in MarketView (not shown). We would reengage many times, resulting in much of the work of mine that you see here.</p>
<p>This work involved extensive planning and collaboration with the backend teams of DASL, Compensation Explorer, and MarketView. It also involved coordination with NAIS member career educators, who would come to use these products we designed for them.</p>

<p>I've collaborated with CareerVillage for the better part of a decade, both as an independent designer and through each of the agencies I've helped grow. Their mission is to democratize access to career guidance, enabling learners from all walks of life to ask professionals questions about careers of interest and receive answers. However, beyond this front-end interaction, there are many additional tools available to students, educators, corporate volunteer teams, and professionals. My contributions to CareerVillage have spanned from interaction design and active in-person community development to product management, even co-leading their roadmap with CEO Jared Chung.</p>
<p>I am a tremendous admirer of their deliberate and considerate approach to work, as well as their positive growth mindset. In fact, they are one of the most collaborative and cross-functional teams I have ever worked with.</p>

<p>During a growth phase, I collaborated with my team to revitalize the design and content of the Imperfect Foods marketing website and e-commerce design patterns. Later, we developed a 5-year visual product roadmap, contributing to a kinder, less wasteful world. Our first project aimed at increasing the average order value, reducing cancellations and bounces, and improving awareness of the value of food 'imperfections'. Our efforts led to a 17% decrease in cancellations, a 20-30% decrease in first-order bounces, and a 10-12% increase in the average value of the first and second orders.</p>
<p>The mobile screens you see here are entirely my work, in collaboration with the Imperfect Foods design team. Other work results from collaboration with my co-designers at Make&amp;Model and at Imperfect Foods.</p>

<p>2014â€“2018 (New York, California, Maine)</p>
<p>UX Camp is a design retreat of intentionally limited size. 30 campers escape the distractions of the city to focus on their craft and to make new friends. Campers work, live, and eat alongside each other, as well as speakers, workshoppers, organizers, and performers. It is a true treat and is poised for many future iterations.</p>
<p>Originally founded as an unconference, UX Camp quickly became an inspiration for many 'camp' style events organized between 2015 and today. That includes another beloved event, Offline Camp, about which I'll write in the future.</p>
<p>Besides one instance where I co-led the event, I have historically handled all fundraising, the sourcing of speakers, workshop coordination, setting event schedules and fallbacks, sourcing musical artists, selecting astonishing venues, managing inclusive dietary catering, and directing all the associated marketing.</p>

<p>As an independent contractor, I collaborated with a small group of developers on a project for Nugget Market, aimed at transforming their grocery technology for both internal use and licensing to other grocery businesses.</p>
<p>My role was partly advisory, focusing on refining the visual design alongside the team's efforts in grocery inventory management, point-of-sale, and purchase order experiences.</p>
<p>Throughout the project, I tested and delivered numerous functional areas of the suite, trained a designer for my client, and led several ideation workshops. These workshops were crucial for sourcing ideas for exploration and testing, and for maintaining momentum in the creative process.</p>

# Product Design Lead / Creative Director / Product Manager

I've collaborated with CareerVillage for the better part of a decade, both as an independent designer and through each of the agencies I've helped grow. Their mission is to democratize access to career guidance, enabling learners from all walks of life to ask professionals questions about careers of interest and receive answers. However, beyond this front-end interaction, there are many additional tools available to students, educators, corporate volunteer teams, and professionals. My contributions to CareerVillage have spanned from interaction design and active in-person community development to product management, even co-leading their roadmap with CEO Jared Chung.

I am a tremendous admirer of their deliberate and considerate approach to work, as well as their positive growth mindset. In fact, they are one of the most collaborative and cross-functional teams I have ever worked with.

# Product Design Lead / Creative Director / Product Manager

I've collaborated with CareerVillage for the better part of a decade, as an independent designer and at each of my agencies I grew. Their mission is to democratize access to career guidance, allowing learners of all walks to ask questions of professionals in their careers of interest today. Think of it as more targeted Quora. On the back side, though, there are many more tools available to students, educators, corporate volunteer teams, and professionals. I've helped CareerVillage on everything from interaction design to coaching product management and co-leading their roadmap with CEO Jared Chung.

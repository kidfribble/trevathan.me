# Product Design Lead / Art Director / Interaction Designer

During a growth phase, I collaborated with my team to revitalize the design and content of the Imperfect Foods marketing website and e-commerce design patterns. Later, we developed a 5-year visual product roadmap, contributing to a kinder, less wasteful world. Our first project aimed at increasing the average order value, reducing cancellations and bounces, and improving awareness of the value of food 'imperfections'. Our efforts led to a 17% decrease in cancellations, a 20-30% decrease in first-order bounces, and a 10-12% increase in the average value of the first and second orders.

The mobile screens you see here are entirely my work, in collaboration with the Imperfect Foods design team. Other work results from collaboration with my co-designers at Make&Model and at Imperfect Foods.

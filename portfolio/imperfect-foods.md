# Product Design Lead / Creative Director

I collaborated with my design team during a growth phase to revitalize the design and content of Imperfect Foods marketing website, e-commerce design patterns, and later developed a 5 year visual product roadmap, contributing to a kinder, less wasteful world. Our first project aimed at increasing average order value, reduce cancellations, bounces, and improve awareness of the value of food 'Imperfections'. Our work led to a 17% decrease in cancellations, a 20-30% decrease in first order bounces, and a 10-12% increase in first and second average order value.

# Product Design Lead / Creative Director

As the principle designer of Make&Model I worked with the CVision team and their customers to conceive of a user experience that would allow marine biologists and researchers to much more efficiently transform huge amounts of video data into actionable insights. Later in the project I worked with a brand designer from my team at Make&Model to work out the core brand tones that the website and the product would take on. The brand direction of this is the product of our collaboration, while the overall product design and organizational experience are my sole work product.

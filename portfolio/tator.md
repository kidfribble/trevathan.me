# Product Design Lead

As the principal designer at Make&Model, I collaborated with the CVision team and their customers to conceive a user experience that would allow marine biologists and researchers to transform huge amounts of video data into actionable insights much more efficiently. Later in the project, I worked with a brand designer from my team at Make&Model to establish the core brand tones that both the website and the product would adopt. The brand direction is the product of our collaboration, while the overall product design and organizational experience are my work.

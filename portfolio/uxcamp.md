## Founder & organizer of UX Camp
2014â€“2018 (New York, California, Maine)

UX camp is a design retreat of intentially limited size. 30 total campers escape the distracting city and focus on their craft together. Campers work, live, and eat alongside each other, speakers, workshoppers, organizers, and musical performers. It is a true treat and will see future iterations.

* Founded as an unconference, UX Camp quickly became inspiration for many 'camp' style events organized between 2015 and today.
* I ran fundraising, sourcing speakers, workshop coordination, setting event schedules and fallbacks, sourcing musical artists, selecting a proper venue, managing catering, and directed all marketing
* During the events (beside one I co-lead in 2018), I lead its programming, volunteers, media recording, and ensured sponsorship was well represented

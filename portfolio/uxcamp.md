# Founder & Organizer
2014â€“2018 (New York, California, Maine)

UX Camp is a design retreat of intentionally limited size. 30 campers escape the distractions of the city to focus on their craft and to make new friends. Campers work, live, and eat alongside each other, as well as speakers, workshoppers, organizers, and performers. It is a true treat and is poised for many future iterations.

Originally founded as an unconference, UX Camp quickly became an inspiration for many 'camp' style events organized between 2015 and today. That includes another beloved event, Offline Camp, about which I'll write in the future.

Besides one instance where I co-led the event, I have historically handled all fundraising, the sourcing of speakers, workshop coordination, setting event schedules and fallbacks, sourcing musical artists, selecting astonishing venues, managing inclusive dietary catering, and directing all the associated marketing.

# Product Design Lead / Creative Director

The National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) originally contracted with my team at Make&Model to make some quick adjustments to their data displays in MarketView (not shown here). We would rengage many times resulting in much of the work of mine that you see here.

The work involved much planning and collaboration with the backend teams of DASL, Compensation Explorer, and MarketView, but also with NAIS member career educators who would come to use the products made available to them.

There's a lot that was processed and sewn into the product experiences demonstrated, though for today, your best bet at getting a good overview is to read the case study on Make&Model's site.

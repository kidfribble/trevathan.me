# Product Design Lead / Creative Director

The National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) originally contracted with my team at Make&Model to make quick adjustments to their data displays in MarketView (not shown). We would reengage many times, resulting in much of the work of mine that you see here.

This work involved extensive planning and collaboration with the backend teams of DASL, Compensation Explorer, and MarketView. It also involved coordination with NAIS member career educators, who would come to use these products we designed for them.

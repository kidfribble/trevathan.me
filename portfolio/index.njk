        <p>Starting with some past customer work (some are fairly old), I'm just scratching the surface here. There's an immense backlog of work over the recent years to cover. I'm posting various side projects and development work over in the <a href="/notes">notes section</a>, and keeping this area focused more on design, community, and my own product work.</p>

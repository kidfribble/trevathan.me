              <ul>
                <li><strong>Imperfect Foods</strong>: I collaborated with my design team during a growth phase to revitalize the design and content of their marketing website, e-commerce design patterns, and later developed a 5 year visual product roadmap, contributing to a kinder, less wasteful world. Our work led to a 17% decrease in cancellations, a 20-30% decrease in first order bounces, and a 10-12% increase in first and second average order value. <a href="https://www.makemodel.co/work/imperfect-foods" target="_blank">&#10230; Case study</a></li>
                <li><strong>CVision</strong>: I directed the design of an open-source software experience for marine biologists to transform huge volumes of oceanic footage into meaningful data for AI training, which would at times used for piloting autonomous underwater vehicles. CVision was funded by NOAA and later lead to our work with MBARI (below). Their training and reporting product is now the standard for AI-driven oceanic research. <a href="https://www.makemodel.co/work/cvision" target="_blank">&#10230; Case study</a></li></li>
                <li><strong>Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute</strong>: Following the creation of CVision's product, I directed the creation of FathomNet, a tool utilized by the marine sciences community for sharing and exploring oceanographic data, as well as aiding in research and education in understanding the marine environment. Think about it as a public database alike iNaturalist for the marine environment. This tool is now utilized by research institutes across the world to unite and improve their observational datasets. <a href="https://www.makemodel.co/work/mbari-fathomnet" target="_blank">&#10230; Case study</a></li>
                <li><strong>National Association of Independent Schools</strong>: In a series of engagements with NAIS, I orchestrated the delivery of their new Market View, DASL, and Compensation Explorer products. Their focus is to allow folks in the business of running independent schools to better assess the trends of their addressable market as well as their spend on attaining new students, to compare and understand performance differences between schools, and to assure appropriately competitive compensation for employees. <a href="https://www.makemodel.co/work/nais" target="_blank">&#10230; Case study</a></li>
                <li><strong>Better Place Forests</strong>: A past client who joined BPF as their CMO had asked me to bring in my team to “upcycle” their brand, to reconsider their entire marketing site content strategy, and to deliver an e-commerce experience designed to help make end-of-life planning more approachable, affordable, and environmentally sound. The relationship proved to be a huge success, enabling their expansion into midwest and eastern forests, and reducing decision friction and the difficulty around discussing death. <a href="https://www.makemodel.co/work/better-place-forests" target="_blank">&#10230; Case study</a></li>
                <li><strong>CareerVillage</strong>: I performed many duties in our partnership with CareerVillage. I directed the design, development, and much of the operations behind producing their current product experience. CareerVillage helps youth get access to career advise they would normally have no clear means of attaining. <br/>

                “Steven was extraordinary both as a Design leader and as a Product leader. Our progress was faster, our site was better, and our users were happier when we hired Steven than they'd ever been before. And he's set a direction for us that has stood the test of time. His impact on our work, and on our users, absolutely can NOT be overstated. I strongly recommend Steven in any context where clarity of thought and consistency of execution is the key to success.” - by Jared Chung, CEO of CareerVillage <a href="https://www.makemodel.co/work/careervillage" target="_blank">&#10230; Case study</a></li>

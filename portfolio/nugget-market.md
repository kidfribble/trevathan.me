# Experience Design Lead

As an independent contractor, I collaborated with a small group of developers on a project for Nugget Market, aimed at transforming their grocery technology for both internal use and licensing to other grocery businesses.

My role was partly advisory, focusing on refining the visual design alongside the team's efforts in grocery inventory management, point-of-sale, and purchase order experiences.

Throughout the project, I tested and delivered numerous functional areas of the suite, trained a designer for my client, and led several ideation workshops. These workshops were crucial for sourcing ideas for exploration and testing, and for maintaining momentum in the creative process.

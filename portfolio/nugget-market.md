# Product Design Lead / Creative Director

I worked with a small group of developers on a project to support Nugget Market as they transformed their grocery technology strategy to prepare for both using it themselves and licensing the grocer business management tools to others.

* UX research of grocery inventory management, point of sale, and purchase order experiences
* UX design and prototyping
* Over the course of this project I tested and delivered many different functional areas of the suite, trained one designer up on the project for my client, and ran several ideation workshops to source ideas for exploration, testing, and to keep momentum on the creative work.

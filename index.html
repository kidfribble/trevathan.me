          <p>My interest in technology began as it has for many people born in the 80s. I was eleven years old when we inherited our first computer, which, through happenstance, quickly became mine. I was fixated. Not long after, I was able to buy my own food for a summer by designing and developing a website for an ice skate retailer in my hometown. A few years later I was picked by my high school's IT shop instructors to work in a local print shop to manage their website design and development, edit their book covers, and to oft times cover or assist other print shop personnel running the presses.<br/>
          
          I am grateful for these experiences.<br/>

          After the print shop, I pursued my degree in graphic design and photography while running a small painting business to support myself. This period of my life was marked by a strong drive and a willingness to experiment, which quickly opened doors for me in my professional journey. I've had the opportunity to join and create many successful product teams as a founder, director, manager, product designer, and developer. If you're reading, I'm likely considering working with you, and I come with a rich background of experience, an eager commitment to skill development, and deep enthusiasm for making meaningful contributions to our ever-improving world.</p>

        <h3>Customer Success</h3>
        <div>
         
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Imperfect Foods</strong>: I collaborated with my design team during a growth phase to revitalize the design and content of their marketing website, e-commerce design patterns, and later developed a 5 year visual product roadmap, contributing to a kinder, less wasteful world. Our work led to a 17% decrease in cancellations, a 20-30% decrease in first order bounces, and a 10-12% increase in first and second average order value. <a href="https://www.makemodel.co/work/imperfect-foods" target="_blank">&#10230; Case study</a></li>
            <li><strong>CVision</strong>: I directed the design of an open-source software experience for marine biologists to transform huge volumes of oceanic footage into meaningful data for AI training, which would at times used for piloting autonomous underwater vehicles. CVision was funded by NOAA and later lead to our work with MBARI (below). Their training and reporting product is now the standard for AI-driven oceanic research. <a href="https://www.makemodel.co/work/cvision" target="_blank">&#10230; Case study</a></li></li>
            <li><strong>Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute</strong>: Following the creation of CVision's product, I directed the creation of FathomNet, a tool utilized by the marine sciences community for sharing and exploring oceanographic data, as well as aiding in research and education in understanding the marine environment. Think about it as a public database alike iNaturalist for the marine environment. This tool is now utilized by research institutes across the world to unite and improve their observational datasets. <a href="https://www.makemodel.co/work/mbari-fathomnet" target="_blank">&#10230; Case study</a></li>
            <li><strong>National Association of Independent Schools</strong>: In a series of engagements with NAIS, I orchestrated the delivery of their new Market View, DASL, and Compensation Explorer products. Their focus is to allow folks in the business of running independent schools to better assess the trends of their addressable market as well as their spend on attaining new students, to compare and understand performance differences between schools, and to assure appropriately competitive compensation for employees. <a href="https://www.makemodel.co/work/nais" target="_blank">&#10230; Case study</a></li>
            <li><strong>Better Place Forests</strong>: A past client who joined BPF as their CMO had asked me to bring in my team to “upcycle” their brand, to reconsider their entire marketing site content strategy, and to deliver an e-commerce experience designed to help make end-of-life planning more approachable, affordable, and environmentally sound. The relationship proved to be a huge success, enabling their expansion into midwest and eastern forests, and reducing decision friction and the difficulty around discussing death. <a href="https://www.makemodel.co/work/better-place-forests" target="_blank">&#10230; Case study</a></li>
            <li><strong>CareerVillage</strong>: I performed many duties in our partnership with CareerVillage. I directed the design, development, and much of the operations behind producing their current product experience. CareerVillage helps youth get access to career advise they would normally have no clear means of attaining. <br/>

            “Steven was extraordinary both as a Design leader and as a Product leader. Our progress was faster, our site was better, and our users were happier when we hired Steven than they'd ever been before. And he's set a direction for us that has stood the test of time. His impact on our work, and on our users, absolutely can NOT be overstated. I strongly recommend Steven in any context where clarity of thought and consistency of execution is the key to success.” - by Jared Chung, CEO of CareerVillage <a href="https://www.makemodel.co/work/careervillage" target="_blank">&#10230; Case study</a></li>

        <p>After working with the founders of Flywheel Sports, formerly a top competitive spin cycling studio with locations around the world, to redefine their in-studio spinning experience and later managing the team running design sprints that would lead to their new product, I had joined their new venture Mariana Tek as their Director of Design. During my time there I directly contributed on product design, user research, usability testing, and paved the way forward for this new team to bring the product to an international market.</p>

        <p>In selling Dobot, I joined DockYard as Partner and Creative Director, eventually co-leading a team of nine designers and twelve engineers. We completed multi-million dollar projects for clients like McGraw Hill Education, NASDAQ, Society of Grownups/Mass Mutual, IDEO, Flywheel Sports, and America's Test Kitchen. After overseeing the team expansion and training my successor, I resigned to embark on a journey to explore the concept of a socially conscious studio, which eventually materialized as Make&Model.</p>

At Fuzz, I designed notable iPhone apps for Condé Nast and the pioneering UGuideMe tour guide system. My responsibilities included redesigning and developing websites for banks, schools, and artists, along with managing client relations. This demanding role tested everything I knew, but my background in print and information technology equipped me to handle the challenging trade-offs and client negotiations.</p>

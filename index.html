      <h1>The Web Resume of Steven Trevathan</h1>
      <h2>Solo Campaign</h2>
      <p>My interest in technology began like it has for a lot of folks born in the 80's. I was eleven years old when we inherited our first computer, which through happenstance became my own very quickly. I was fixated. Shortly after, I was hired as a pre-teen to design and develop an e-commerce site for an ice skating manufacturer in my hometown.</br>

      Fast forwarding through working in a print shop, then earning my degree as a designer and photographer while running a small painting business, my drive and experimentation has opened doors for me to join and create many successful product teams as a founder, director, manager, product designer, and a developer.</p>

        <h2>Career Objective</h2>
        <p>I am humbled and grateful that millions depend on my handiwork. Eager to contribute my experience to a thoughtful, diverse, and collaborative team, I aim to enhance their products and bring out the best in our collective efforts.</p>
